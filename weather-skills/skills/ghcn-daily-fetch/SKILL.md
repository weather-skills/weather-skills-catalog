description: Fetch NOAA GHCN-Daily global in-situ station observations (precipitation, max/min/avg temperature) for a date range and region, and write a point_obs weather-skills standard dataset Zarr. Use when a task needs credential-free worldwide daily station data, e.g. to compare against gridded satellite, reanalysis, or forecast data.

# ghcn-daily-fetch

Downloads NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network daily station observations
from the public, credential-free GHCN-Daily S3 dataset. It reads the station
metadata file to find stations inside the requested bounding box, downloads each
candidate station's per-station CSV concurrently, keeps only QC-passed rows for
the requested elements and date range, scales them to canonical units, and writes
a point_obs Zarr store.

The output is a fully CF-1.13 timeSeries Discrete Sampling Geometries (DSG) Zarr
plus the `weather_skills_history` provenance key — a superset of CF, not a separate format.

GHCN-Daily has ~130k stations and each is a separate whole-history download, so a
`--bbox` bounds the work to the stations you need.

## When to use

- A task needs recent or historical daily station observations anywhere in the
  world, without credentials.
- A downstream skill will compare stations against gridded precip/temperature
  (via `plot-compare`) or aggregate them temporally.

For African stations with sub-daily sensor data, `tahmo-fetch` is an alternative
(credentialed).

## Usage

```
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py [--bbox N/W/S/E] --start-time YYYY-MM-DD --end-time YYYY-MM-DD [-v VAR ...] -o <path.zarr>
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --probe-latest
```

### Arguments
- `--start-time`, `--end-time` — inclusive date range. Each value is an absolute ISO date
  `YYYY-MM-DD`. Calendar windows: `resolve-time last-2w`. Latest published day: `--probe-latest`. A
  missing trailing tail near the present is treated as a normal partial window,
  not an error.
- `--probe-latest` — print the latest available `YYYY-MM-DD` on stdout and exit. No `-o`.
- `--bbox` — spatial subset `N/W/S/E` decimal degrees, used to select stations
  from the GHCN station metadata. Bounds the work to the stations inside the box;
  omitting it (or giving an over-wide box) selects many stations, each a separate
  whole-history download. To fetch over a country, get its bbox from the
  `resolve-region` skill.
- `--variable`, `-v` — restrict to one variable; repeat once per variable. Choices:
  `precip`, `tmax`, `tmin`, `tavg`. Omit for the default `precip tmax tmin`.
- `--output`, `-o` — output Zarr path (overwritten if it exists).
- `--workers` — max concurrent per-station download threads (default 8). A
  concurrency knob only; it does not change the output. Lower it if the server
  returns throttling errors.

### Dropped-station observability

A per-station fetch that fails is retried once; if it still fails the station is
dropped and the run continues. Each drop is logged per-line, and an aggregate
count of dropped stations is printed to stderr at the end so failures are never
silently lost.

### Output

Zarr with dims `(time, station_id)`, coords `latitude(station_id)`,
`longitude(station_id)`, `name(station_id)`, and data variables among `precip`
(mm day-1), `tmax`/`tmin`/`tavg` (`degree_Celsius`) — whichever were requested and present.
GHCN-Daily values are stored in tenths (tenths of mm for PRCP, tenths of °C for
temperature) and are scaled to these canonical units on the way out. Only rows
whose quality flag is empty (passed all QC checks) are kept.

The store is fully **CF-1.13 timeSeries DSG** compliant — verified with
`cf-xarray` before writing — plus the `weather_skills_history` provenance key:

- Global attrs: `Conventions="CF-1.13"`, `featureType="timeSeries"`, plus
  `title`, `source`, `institution`, `references`, and `history`.
- `station_id` carries `cf_role="timeseries_id"` (the attr cf-xarray keys the
  geometry off).
- Every data variable carries `coordinates="latitude longitude time"`,
  udunits-valid `units`, a CF-table `standard_name`, a `long_name`,
  `cell_methods`, and an explicit `_FillValue` (in the write encoding) for the
  ragged station-time cells a station did not report.
- `latitude`/`longitude` carry `standard_name`/`units`
  (`degrees_north`/`degrees_east`); `time` carries `standard_name=time` with
  udunits `units` + `calendar` in the write encoding.
- `weather_skills_source=ghcn-daily`.

Missing station-time cells are NaN (with a matching `_FillValue` carried in the
write encoding). Units are
validated against udunits before the write; if a variable's units string is not
udunits-valid the run fails rather than emit a false CF claim.

### Memory and performance

Memory scales with the number of stations inside `--bbox` times the window length
times the selected variables — station rows are small, and the working set is
bounded by the bbox, not the global station list. Per-station CSVs are fetched
concurrently and each is held only transiently while its daily values are
extracted; `--workers` raises download concurrency at a modest, bounded memory
cost. On tight-memory hosts, narrow the `--bbox` or shorten the window.

### Provenance

The output stamps a JSON-encoded `weather_skills_history` attr: an append-only array of
per-step entries `{skill, version, args, input}`. For this fetcher it is a
length-1 array with `skill="ghcn-daily-fetch"` and `input=null`; downstream
zarr-writing skills append their own entry. `args` records `bbox`, the sorted
`variable` list, and `start`/`end` — `--workers` is excluded (a concurrency knob
that does not change the data). `version` is this
skill's version, also printed by `--help`. Inspect a written output's provenance
with the `provenance` skill.

## Examples

```bash
# Precip + max temperature for NYC-area stations over three days
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --bbox 41/-74/40/-73 --start-time 2024-06-01 --end-time 2024-06-03 \
  -v precip -v tmax -o /tmp/ghcn.zarr

# Default variables (precip, tmax, tmin) over a country for three weeks
# (dummy bbox; use resolve-region for a real one)
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --bbox 5/34/-5/42 --start-time 2024-06-01 --end-time 2024-06-21 \
  -o /tmp/ghcn_kenya.zarr
```
