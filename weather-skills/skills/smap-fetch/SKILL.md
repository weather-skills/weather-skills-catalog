Use when a task needs gridded land-surface soil-moisture observations, e.g. for drought or agricultural analysis, or comparison against models.

# smap-fetch

Downloads NASA SMAP Enhanced L3 radiometer soil moisture (`SPL3SMP_E`, 9 km,
daily) granules from NASA Earthdata via `earthaccess` and writes a gridded Zarr
store. The product is HDF5 on the global EASE-Grid 2.0; its degenerate 2-D
latitude/longitude reduce to 1-D coordinate vectors, so the output is a regular
1-D lat/lon weather-skills standard dataset. Each requested day is one ~690 MB granule, so this
skill is built for a bounded `--bbox` over a short window — pass `--bbox`.

## When to use

- A task needs gridded surface soil-moisture observations (daily, 9 km, land)
  over a bounded region.
- A downstream skill will clip, aggregate, compare, or plot the result as a weather-skills
  standard dataset Zarr.

## Usage

```
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --start-time YYYY-MM-DD --end-time YYYY-MM-DD [--bbox N/W/S/E] [--overpass AM|PM] -o <path.zarr>
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --probe-latest
```

Requires Earthdata credentials in the environment (`EARTHDATA_USERNAME` /
`EARTHDATA_PASSWORD`) or a `.netrc` entry for `urs.earthdata.nasa.gov`, exactly
like `imerg-fetch`.

### Arguments
- `--start-time`, `--end-time` — inclusive date range. Each value is an absolute ISO date
  `YYYY-MM-DD`. Keep windows short — each day is a separate large granule.
  Calendar windows: `resolve-time last-2w`. Latest published day: `--probe-latest`.
- `--probe-latest` — print the latest available `YYYY-MM-DD` on stdout and exit. No `-o`.
- `--bbox` — spatial subset `N/W/S/E` decimal degrees (optional). Strongly
  recommended for every run, since each daily granule is the entire ~690 MB
  global grid. SMAP longitudes are already in [-180, 180), so negative west/east
  values select directly. A box with west > east is treated as
  antimeridian-crossing (e.g. `12/170/-6/-170`): it selects the union of the two
  longitude bands (lon ≥ west or lon ≤ east). To fetch over a country, resolve
  its bbox with the `resolve-region` skill.
- `--overpass` — which half-orbit group to read: `AM` (6am descending, default)
  or `PM` (6pm ascending).
- `--output`, `-o` — output Zarr path (overwritten if it exists).

### Output

A consolidated, fully **CF-1.13** weather-skills standard dataset Zarr with dims
`(time, latitude, longitude)`. The store is CF-compliant first, with
`weather_skills_history` added on top — the standard dataset is a CF superset, not a separate
format.

- Global attrs: `Conventions="CF-1.13"`, `title`, `source` (SMAP SPL3SMP_E),
  `institution`, `references`, `history`, plus `weather_skills_source="smap"` and
  `weather_skills_history`.
- `latitude`: `standard_name=latitude`, `units=degrees_north`, `axis=Y`;
  `longitude`: `standard_name=longitude`, `units=degrees_east`, `axis=X`;
  `time`: `standard_name=time`, `axis=T`, with udunits `units` + `calendar` in
  the write encoding.
- `soil_moisture`:
  `standard_name="volume_fraction_of_condensed_water_in_soil"`, `units="m3 m-3"`
  (the file's `cm3/cm3` is a dimensionless volumetric ratio; `m3 m-3` is its
  udunits-valid, dimensionless CF form — equivalent to a bare `1` but more
  meaningful to downstream tools; the human form is kept in `long_name`). The
  granule's own `soil_moisture` units attribute is read and confirmed to be the
  expected dimensionless ratio before relabeling; an unexpected value fails the
  run rather than silently mislabeling. Also carries `long_name`, an explicit NaN
  `_FillValue`, and a `grid_mapping="latitude_longitude"` reference. The written
  units are validated against udunits before write.
- A `latitude_longitude` `grid_mapping` variable carries the geographic CRS for
  the lat/lon presentation of the EASE-Grid 2.0 cells, on the WGS84 ellipsoid
  (EASE-Grid 2.0 is defined on WGS84). Latitude is the EASE-Grid 2.0 vector
  (non-uniformly spaced, descending), preserved exactly; ocean and no-retrieval
  cells are NaN.

`cf-xarray` resolves the X/Y/T axes from these attrs, and the script runs that
decode check on write — a stamping regression fails loudly rather than shipping
a store downstream skills cannot read.

### Auth errors

Earthdata authentication is non-interactive: the script tries the `environment`
(EARTHDATA_USERNAME/PASSWORD or EARTHDATA_TOKEN) then `netrc` strategy and never
prompts. If neither yields an authenticated session — or a search/download
returns 401/403 — it exits non-zero with a single actionable line
("configure EARTHDATA_USERNAME/EARTHDATA_PASSWORD or a urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
entry in ~/.netrc"). No credential value is read, printed, or checked, and no
traceback is shown for the auth path.

### Missing days

If some requested days have no published granule, the script writes the days
that exist and emits a stderr warning naming the skipped days, rather than
silently returning a shorter result. The warning distinguishes trailing missing
days (after the last available day — the usual publication-lag case near the
present) from interior gaps (a missing day between two available days), so it
does not assert a false "not yet published" cause for a genuine interior gap.

### Provenance

The output stamps a JSON-encoded `weather_skills_history` attr: an append-only array of
per-step entries `{skill, version, args, input}`. For this fetcher it is a
length-1 array with `skill="smap-fetch"` and `input=null`; downstream
zarr-writing skills append their own entry. `args` records `bbox`, `overpass`,
and `start`/`end`. `version` is this skill's version, also
printed by `--help`. Inspect a written output's provenance with the `provenance`
skill.

### Memory and performance

Each requested day is one ~690 MB granule, so keep the window short and
`--bbox` tight. Downloaded granules are staged to a temp directory, so disk,
not RAM, bounds the window. Run the `clip-region` skill afterward for further
trimming.

## Examples

```bash
# Soil moisture over a Horn-of-Africa bbox for two days (AM overpass)
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --bbox 12/32/-6/52 --start-time 2024-06-01 --end-time 2024-06-02 \
  -o /tmp/smap.zarr

# One week ending at a recent date, PM overpass
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --bbox 12/32/-6/52 --start-time 2024-05-26 --end-time 2024-06-01 \
  --overpass PM -o /tmp/smap_pm.zarr
```
