# rename

Source-agnostic variable-rename primitive. Renames one data variable
(`--variable`) to a new name (`--to-name`) via xarray's `ds.rename`, writing a
new Zarr whose renamed variable keeps all of its own attrs. Coordinates and
dimensions are out of scope; only a data variable is renamed.

## When to use

- A data variable needs a different name.
- Two datasets carry the same quantity under different variable names and need
  to match.

## Usage

```
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/rename.py --input <in.zarr> --output <out.zarr> \
    --to-name <NAME> [--variable NAME]
```

The output must be a distinct store from the input; the skill rejects a run
where `--input` and `--output` resolve to the same store or one nested inside
the other.

### Arguments
- `--input`, `-i` — input Zarr containing a weather-skills standard dataset.
- `--output`, `-o` — output Zarr (a distinct path from `--input`).
- `--to-name` — the new variable name; becomes the output variable's name.
- `--variable`, `-v` — source data variable to rename. If omitted and the input
  has a single data variable, that one is used. If multiple data vars are
  present, `--variable` is required.

Renaming `--variable` to a name it already has is a valid no-op: the output is
written with a fresh provenance entry so it can still be the store a downstream
step reads.

### Output

Same dims, coords, and data variables as the input, except the selected variable
is named `--to-name`. The renamed variable keeps all of its own attrs; all other
variables, coords, dims, and dataset attrs are unchanged.

The skill exits with code 2 and a clear message when: the input is missing; the
output exists and is not a directory; `--variable` names a value that is not a
data variable; the input has multiple data vars and no `--variable` is given; or
`--to-name` already names a different existing variable, coordinate, or
dimension (renaming onto it would clash).

### Provenance

The output stamps a JSON-encoded `weather_skills_history` attr: an append-only
array of per-step entries `{skill, version, args, input}`. This skill reads the
upstream input's `weather_skills_history` (default `[]` and stderr warning if
absent) and appends its own entry. `args` is the argparse namespace minus the
`--input`/`--output` path strings; `input` is a `{basename, hash}` dict —
`basename` is the upstream zarr's filename and `hash` is a sha256 of its stored
bytes, so a renamed-but-unchanged input still cache-hits and a
same-named-but-modified input correctly cache-misses; `version` is the
`_SKILL_VERSION` constant in `scripts/rename.py`.

The `args` dict stores argparse dest names (underscored, e.g. `to_name`), not
the hyphenated CLI flag names (`--to-name`). A consumer reconstructing a
`uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/<skill>.py <args>` invocation must
translate underscore → hyphen.

## Example

IMERG names its precipitation variable `precip`; IFS names it
`precipitation_surface`. Rename each to a shared `precipitation`:

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/rename.py -i /tmp/imerg.zarr -o /tmp/imerg_renamed.zarr \
    --variable precip --to-name precipitation

uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/rename.py -i /tmp/ifs.zarr -o /tmp/ifs_renamed.zarr \
    --variable precipitation_surface --to-name precipitation
```

Both renamed stores now carry the same variable name, so they merge cleanly:
concatenate the obs and forecast along `time` with the `concat` skill
(`-i /tmp/imerg_renamed.zarr -i /tmp/ifs_renamed.zarr --dim time -o /tmp/combined.zarr`).
