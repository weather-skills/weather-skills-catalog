# arco-era5-fetch

Opens the [ARCO-ERA5](https://github.com/google-research/arco-era5) analysis-ready
Zarr store (`gs://gcp-public-data-arco-era5/ar/full_37-1h-0p25deg-chunk-1.zarr-v3`),
subsets it by bounding box, time range, and variables, maps it onto the weather-skills
standard dataset analysis shape, and writes a consolidated Zarr store. The store is a
uniform 0.25° equiangular lat/lon grid, hourly, opened with anonymous Google
Cloud access — no credentials and no API queue.

## When to use

- A task needs multi-variable reanalysis (2m temperature, winds, precipitation,
  geopotential, pressure-level fields) as gridded observations/ground truth.
- A downstream skill will clip, aggregate, compare, or plot the result as a weather-skills
  standard dataset Zarr.

Not a forecast — ERA5 is reanalysis. For forecast grids prefer
`dynamical-fetch`; use `ecmwf-fetch` only for ECMWF S2S.

## Usage

```
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --start-time YYYY-MM-DD --end-time YYYY-MM-DD [--bbox N/W/S/E] [-v VAR ...] -o <path.zarr>
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --probe-latest
```

### Arguments
- `--start-time`, `--end-time` — inclusive date range. Each value is an absolute ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`. Calendar windows: `resolve-time last-2w`. Latest published day: `--probe-latest`.
- `--probe-latest` — print the latest available `YYYY-MM-DD` on stdout and exit (Zarr time coordinate). No `-o`.
- `--bbox` — spatial subset `N/W/S/E` decimal degrees. Longitudes are normalized
  to the [-180, 180) convention, so negative west/east values select correctly on
  ERA5's native 0..360 grid. The slice follows each axis's own order, so any
  region works. A bbox whose west is greater than its east is read as crossing
  the antimeridian (e.g. `10/170/-10/-170`): the cells with `lon >= west` or
  `lon <= east` are kept and the interior band is dropped, preserving the grid's
  native ascending longitude order. The two dateline-flanking spans (the cells
  near +180 followed by the cells near -180) stay in ascending order — monotonic,
  though not physically contiguous across the dateline — so downstream tools that
  assume a sorted longitude keep working.
  Omit to fetch the full native grid. To fetch over a country, get its bbox from
  the `resolve-region` skill.
- `--variable`, `-v` — restrict to one data variable; repeat once per variable
  (`-v 2m_temperature -v total_precipitation`). Almost always supply at least one:
  ARCO-ERA5 carries hundreds of surface and pressure-level fields, and omitting
  `--variable` selects all of them. An unknown name exits 2 and prints the
  available variables.
- `--output`, `-o` — output Zarr path (overwritten if it exists).

### Output

A consolidated, fully CF-1.13 compliant weather-skills standard dataset analysis Zarr with a
`time` dimension and dims `(time, latitude, longitude)` — plus `level` when a
pressure-level variable is selected. The weather-skills standard dataset is a CF superset: the
output passes CF first, then carries the `weather_skills_history` provenance key.

CF stamping on the output:

- **Global attrs:** `Conventions="CF-1.13"`, plus `title`, `institution`,
  `source` (the ARCO-ERA5 store path), `references`, and `history`.
- **Coordinates:** `latitude` (`standard_name=latitude`, `units=degrees_north`,
  `axis=Y`), `longitude` (`standard_name=longitude`, `units=degrees_east`,
  `axis=X`), `time` (`standard_name=time`, `axis=T`, with CF `units` and
  `calendar=proleptic_gregorian` carried in the on-disk encoding). When a
  pressure-level variable is selected, `level` carries `standard_name=air_pressure`,
  `units=hPa`, and `positive=down`.
- **Data variables:** every variable carries a udunits-valid `units` and a
  `long_name`. Known air-temperature and precip kinds are converted to
  standard display units (`degree_Celsius`, `mm day-1`); remaining variables
  keep the ARCO store's `units`/`long_name`/`standard_name`. A few udunits-invalid
  unit placeholders the store uses
  (`(0 - 1)`, `~`, `dimensionless`, `m of water equivalent`) are normalized to a
  CF-valid spelling. Each variable's final `units` string is then validated
  against udunits: a variable whose source units are missing, or are
  non-parseable and not covered by that normalization map, is a hard failure —
  the fetcher exits non-zero naming the variable and its offending units rather
  than writing invalid units under a `Conventions="CF-1.13"` claim. A
  missing-units variable is never silently relabeled dimensionless.
  `standard_name` is set when the store supplies one or a curated value applies,
  and omitted otherwise (CF permits this).

Stamped with `weather_skills_source=arco-era5`.

### Memory, performance, and error handling

`--bbox` and `--variable` are the levers that set how much data is pulled: the
selection size is variables × levels × bbox cells × window length, read and
written once — xarray prunes to the selection before pulling any array bytes, so
an unselected variable or out-of-bbox cell is never materialized.

The selection is materialized into host memory in a single eager `.to_zarr()`
load, so a very large request (no `--bbox`, all variables, a pressure-level
variable spanning all 37 levels, or a long window) is slow and may exhaust
memory. The fetcher does not refuse a request on a size estimate — what to fetch
is your call. Keep a request affordable by selecting the specific variables you
need, keeping `--bbox` tight, and keeping the window to days or a small number of
weeks; run `clip-region` afterward to shrink further.

Errors are reported reactively. Store-open, network, and path failures emit a
one-line actionable message instead of a raw traceback. If the eager load
actually runs out of memory and raises a catchable `MemoryError`, the fetcher
reports it and suggests narrowing with `-v`, `--bbox`, or a shorter window (under
Linux memory overcommit an OOM may instead kill the process outright, printing
only "Killed").

### Provenance

The output stamps a JSON-encoded `weather_skills_history` attr: an append-only array of
per-step entries `{skill, version, args, input}`. For this fetcher it is a
length-1 array with `skill="arco-era5-fetch"` and `input=null`; downstream
zarr-writing skills append their own entry. `args` records every option except
the `--output` path — `start`, `end`, `bbox`, and `variable`. `version` is this skill's
version, also printed by `--help`. Inspect a written output's provenance with the
`provenance` skill.

The `args` dict stores option names with underscores, not the hyphenated CLI flag
names. A consumer reconstructing a `uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py <args>`
invocation must translate underscore → hyphen.

## Examples

```bash
# 2m temperature over a country for two days (dummy bbox; use resolve-region for a real one)
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --start-time 2026-01-01 --end-time 2026-01-02 \
  --bbox 5/34/-5/42 -v 2m_temperature -o /tmp/arco.zarr

# One week, two variables, continental Africa (custom bbox)
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --start-time 2026-05-24 --end-time 2026-05-30 \
  --bbox 23/-20/-37/59 -v 2m_temperature -v total_precipitation -o /tmp/arco_week.zarr

# A pressure-level variable for one day — adds a CF `level` (air_pressure) dim
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --start-time 2026-01-01 --end-time 2026-01-01 \
  --bbox 5/34/-5/42 -v temperature -o /tmp/arco_level.zarr
```
