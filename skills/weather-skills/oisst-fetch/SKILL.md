# oisst-fetch

Reads NOAA's Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) v2.1 daily
0.25° global analysis from NOAA PSL's public OPeNDAP server, subsets it by
bounding box and time range, maps it onto the weather-skills standard dataset analysis shape, and
writes a consolidated Zarr store. OPeNDAP lets the skill pull only the requested
window rather than whole yearly files, with no credentials.

## When to use

- A task needs gridded sea-surface temperature observations (daily, 0.25°,
  global, 1981-09 to present), without credentials.
- A downstream skill will clip, aggregate, compare, or plot the result as a weather-skills
  standard dataset Zarr.

## Usage

```
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --start-time YYYY-MM-DD --end-time YYYY-MM-DD [--bbox N/W/S/E] -o <path.zarr>
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --probe-latest
```

### Arguments
- `--start-time`, `--end-time` — inclusive date range. Each value is an absolute ISO date
  `YYYY-MM-DD`. Calendar windows: `resolve-time last-2w`. Latest published day: `--probe-latest`.
- `--probe-latest` — print the latest available `YYYY-MM-DD` on stdout and exit. No `-o`.
- `--bbox` — spatial subset `N/W/S/E` decimal degrees. Longitudes are normalized
  to the [-180, 180) convention so negative west/east values select correctly on
  OISST's native 0..360 grid. Omit for the full global grid. To fetch over a
  region, get its bbox from the `resolve-region` skill.
- `--output`, `-o` — output Zarr path (overwritten if it exists).

### Output

A consolidated weather-skills standard dataset analysis Zarr with a `time` dimension and dims
`(time, latitude, longitude)`, carrying `sst` (sea-surface temperature, °C).
Land cells are NaN. Stamped with `weather_skills_source=oisst`.

The store is fully **CF-1.13** compliant (the weather-skills standard dataset is a CF superset —
CF plus the `weather_skills_history` provenance key):

- Global attrs: `Conventions="CF-1.13"`, `title`, `source` (NOAA OISST v2.1, read
  over NOAA PSL OPeNDAP), `institution`, `references`, `history`.
- `latitude`/`longitude`: `standard_name`, `units` (`degrees_north`/
  `degrees_east`), `axis` (`Y`/`X`).
- `time`: `standard_name=time`, `axis=T`, with an explicit udunits `units` and
  `calendar` in the write encoding.
- `sst`: `standard_name=sea_surface_temperature`, `long_name`, `units`
  (`degree_Celsius`), and an explicit NaN `_FillValue` in
  the encoding for land cells.

cf-xarray resolves the X/Y/T axes on the output, and the write is gated on that
decode succeeding.

### Memory and performance

There is one variable (`sst`); `--bbox` and the window length are the memory
levers. Each year's bbox selection is loaded, written, and released before the
next, so peak resident memory is bounded to a single year's selection (the full
global grid is ~720×1440, roughly 4 MB per day as float32). Keep `--bbox` tight
and the window short; run the `clip-region` skill afterward to trim further.

### Errors

OISST is served over NOAA PSL's OPeNDAP server, which limits request size. The
skill reports failures reactively — it does not pre-estimate request size or
refuse against any threshold — so the messages below appear only after the
provider or the resolver fails:

- **Transport / oversized request** — the data transfer is rejected at load time
  (a DAP failure, typically a large `--bbox` over a long window). The message
  names the remedy: reduce `--bbox` and/or shorten the date range; this is not a
  credentials or availability problem, so retrying the same request will not help.
- **Availability** — a year file cannot be opened. The year may be outside the
  served range (1981-09 to present) or the server is unreachable; check the date
  range. Distinct from the oversized case.
- **Empty window** — the requested window is in range but contains no data; exits
  with a "no data in window" message, kept distinct from a failure.

Exit codes: exit `2` covers pre-network argument/parse errors (a malformed
`--start-time`/`--end-time` date, a reversed range, or a malformed `--bbox`) and
load-time data-transfer failures on a year's slice (transport, availability, or
an unexpected read failure). Exit `1` covers the remaining failures: the
empty-window case, a year-file open failure, a `--bbox` that selects no grid
cells, and a CF stamping or decode failure.

If a multi-year window fails partway through (a later year's transfer fails after
an earlier year was written), the partial store is removed before the non-zero
exit.

### Provenance

The output stamps a JSON-encoded `weather_skills_history` attr: an append-only array of
per-step entries `{skill, version, args, input}`. For this fetcher it is a
length-1 array with `skill="oisst-fetch"` and `input=null`; downstream
zarr-writing skills append their own entry. `args` records the `bbox` and
`start`/`end`. `version` is this skill's version, also printed
by `--help`. Inspect a written output's provenance with the `provenance` skill.

## Examples

```bash
# SST over a coastal bbox for three days (dummy bbox; use resolve-region for a real one)
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --bbox 5/34/-5/42 --start-time 2024-06-01 --end-time 2024-06-03 \
  -o /tmp/oisst.zarr

# Three weeks over a bounded region
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --bbox 5/34/-5/42 --start-time 2024-05-12 --end-time 2024-06-01 \
  -o /tmp/oisst_week.zarr
```
