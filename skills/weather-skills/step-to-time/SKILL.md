description: Realize a forecast dataset's `step` lead-time axis as wall-clock valid times (`time = init + step`), replacing the `step` dim with a `time` dim. Use it to compare a forecast against observations — e.g. before plot-compare, plot-timeseries, or difference against a time-based dataset.

# step-to-time

Axis-realization primitive. A forecast dataset labels its temporal axis with
lead times — a `step` dim (`timedelta64`) plus a scalar `time` coord holding
the forecast init date — while observation datasets carry a wall-clock `time`
dim (`datetime64`). Skills that compare the two need both inputs on the same
kind of axis. This skill computes `valid_time = init + step` and rewrites the
standard dataset with the `step` dim replaced by a `time` dim labeled with those valid
times.

## When to use

- To compare a forecast against observations: run it on the forecast before
  feeding both inputs to `plot-compare`, `plot-timeseries`, or `difference`
  against a time-based dataset (e.g. CHIRPS, IMERG, station data).
- Whenever a downstream consumer needs the forecast's values labeled by the
  date they are valid for rather than by lead time.

## Input precondition

The input must have a `step` dim whose values are `timedelta64` lead times AND
a scalar (0-d) `time` coord holding the forecast init date. The init may be a
standard `datetime64` or, for a non-standard model calendar (`noleap`,
`360_day`), an object-dtype `cftime` datetime. An input that already has a
`time` dim is already on a wall-clock axis and is rejected; an input that has
BOTH a `time` dim and a `step` dim (a multi-init/hindcast cube) is rejected with
a message to select a single init first.

## Usage

```
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/step_to_time.py --input <in.zarr> --output <out.zarr>
```

### Arguments
- `--input`, `-i` — input Zarr containing a forecast dataset with a `step` dim
  and a scalar `time` init coord.
- `--output`, `-o` — output Zarr.

### Output

Same data variables, values, and non-temporal dims/coords (`number`, lat/lon)
as the input, EXCEPT the `step` dim is replaced by a `time` dim of the same
length whose coord holds the realized valid times (`init + step`), stamped with
CF attrs (`standard_name: time`, `axis: T`). For a `datetime64` init the
realized axis is cast to `datetime64[ns]` so the output resolution is consistent
regardless of the init/step source resolution; for a `cftime` init the realized
axis stays as `cftime` objects. The valid times carry the init's time-of-day
(midnight if the init is date-only, e.g. `datetime64[D]`). The scalar `time`
init coord and the `step` coord are dropped, as is any pre-existing
`valid_time` coord (it would otherwise pass through stale alongside the new
axis); the init date is written to the dataset attr `weather_skills_forecast_init`
(ISO 8601, the `cftime` ISO string for a non-standard-calendar init).

If the input lacks a `step` dim, the `step` dim is empty, the `step` values are
not `timedelta64`, the input already has a `time` dim (or both a `time` and a
`step` dim), there is no scalar `time` init coord, the init is neither
`datetime64` nor `cftime`, the init is missing/NaT, or the realized valid times
are not strictly increasing, the skill exits with code 2 and a clear message. A
path that exists but is not a readable Zarr store also exits 2 with a clear
message.

### Provenance

The output stamps a JSON-encoded `weather_skills_history` attr: the input's chain plus
an entry for this run, each entry `{skill, version, args, input}` (the
`version` recorded in this skill's own entry is the value printed by its
`--help`; inherited upstream entries carry their own versions). Flag values in
`args` are recorded under underscored names (e.g. a flag `--time-dim` is
recorded as `time_dim`); translate underscore → hyphen when reconstructing a
CLI invocation. Inspect a written output's lineage with the `provenance` skill.

Re-running with identical arguments against an unchanged input and an existing
output is a cheap no-op — reuse the same output path. A cache hit requires the
same skill `version`, the same flags, the same input name, the same input
content, and the same upstream history; any modification to the input forces a
recompute (a renamed-but-unchanged input misses, and a modified same-named
input misses).

## Example

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/step_to_time.py -i /tmp/ecmwf_daily.zarr -o /tmp/ecmwf_valid.zarr
